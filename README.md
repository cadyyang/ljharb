Hiâ€¼ My name's [Jordan](https://twitter.com/ljharb), and I've gradually mutated over the last decade into being super obsessed with open source, backwards compatibility, and finding ways to balance what I feel are ethical obligations to *all* users of projects I interact with, with the very real problem of time management, burnout, and work/life balance.

I've been a part of TC39 (the committee that writes the specification for JavaScript) since 2014, and I've been an editor of the specification since 2018. I've been heavily involved in the node community for as many years, and I've gradually created (but mostly inherited or been gifted) a decent number of open source projects. I persist in trying to maintain them all with maximal back compat, the strictest adherence to semver, and the greatest respect for users.

# How Sponsorship Helps

Although open source is a huge part of my life, it's not the most important part - I have a spouse, kids, and a dog; bills to pay; and I also try to give back to the wider community.

Sponsorship helps fund domains, travel, but also *other sponsorships*
